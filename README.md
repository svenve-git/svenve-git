### Hi there 👋

I'm Sven! 

Starting Full-Stack Developer. Mostly at home in the React ecosystem, and with a fondness of data/state management, e.g. Redux, Sequelize, and GraphQL. Looking to learn more about Security.

My background is interdisciplinary. Yeah, no one really knows what it means (do ask me and I'll try to convince you of it's importance), but it's basically for people who are good at exact sciences and also care about real life. I went into Neuroscience, International Public Health, and later Science and Technology Studies, and learned to look at things in a bunch of different ways. Also, I love snowboarding 🏂🏔️ and my partner is from South Africa 🌊🏄‍, which means I have mixed feelings about Christmas.

If you are curious about what I've been working on recently, you can find my recent work below here! If you want to know more about me / my background,  you could have a look at my LinkedIn profile (https://www.linkedin.com/in/sven-van-ewijk/), or contact me! You can find my details to the left <-----.
