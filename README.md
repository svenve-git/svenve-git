### Hi there 👋

I'm Sven! 

Starting Full-Stack Developer looking to make positive change. Mostly at home in the React ecosystem, and currently practicing TypeScript, GraphQL and React Native.

My background is interdisciplinary. Yeah, no one really knows what it means (do ask me and I'll try to convince you of it's importance!), but it's basically for people who are good at exact sciences and also care about real life. After dipping my toes in Math I went into Neuroscience, International Public Health, and later Science and Technology Studies, and learned to look at things in a bunch of different ways. Also, I love snowboarding 🏂🏔️ and my partner is from South Africa 🌊🏄‍, so I have mixed feelings about Christmas.

If you are curious about what I've been working on recently, you can find my repo's right below! And if you want to know more about me / my background,  you could have a look at my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sven-van-ewijk/), or reach out! You can find my details somewhere over on the left <-----.
